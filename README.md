# myJavaProjects

This is a collection of some Java projects I have done.

# lexi

Lexi sorts four given strings lexigraphically, or alphabetically. I did this without arrays to challenge myself with conditional programming.

# palindrome

Palindrome tells if a word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backwards and forwards.

# rock, paper, scissors

This is a standard rock paper scissors game that displays your record after each game.

# tree

This prints a tree made of asteriks to the console.
